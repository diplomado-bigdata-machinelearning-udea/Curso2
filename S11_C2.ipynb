Cuando se tiene esta segmentación el paso a seguir, como estrategia de venta, es ofrecer servicios a través de contact centers a cada grupo de acuerdo a lo que se considere pertinente. Uno de estos servicios son los depositos a plazo fijo, por los cuales podemos tener cierta ganancia al dejar nuestro dinero depositado por cierto tiempo en una entidad bancaria, es por esto que para el siguiente ejemplo usaremos un dataset llamado **Bank Marketing Data set**, el cual puede ser encontrado en la siguiente [página web](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing); este dataset posee información obtenida a partir de unas campañas de marketing realizadas por algunas entidades bancarias portuguesas, en donde se busca a partir de cierta información determinar si el cliente se suscribirá a un déposito a plazo fijo. Para este dataset tenemos los siguientes atributos:\n","\n"," 1-Age (numeric)\n","\n"," 2-job :type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')\n","\n"," 3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)\n"," \n"," 4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')\n","\n"," 5 - default: has credit in default?

Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n","\n"," **other attributes:**\n","\n","12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)\n","\n","13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n","\n","14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n","\n","15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')\n","**social and economic context attributes**\n","\n","16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)\n","\n","20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","Además de la etiqueta que tenemos:\n","\n","21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit?

por la radiación solar para formar iones, que tienen una carga eléctrica. El Ionosphere Data Set contiene información captada por radares, los cuales buscaban detectar electrones libres en esta capa de la atmosfera, donde estas antenas regresaban a partir de señales \"good\" si detectaban algún elemento en la ionósfera o \"bad\" en caso contrario.\n","\n","<p><img alt=\"Colaboratory logo\" height=\"200px\" src=\"https://t2.ev.ltmcdn.com/es/posts/6/1/7/atmosfera_y_cuales_son_sus_capas_para_ninos_de_primaria_1716_600.jpg\" align=\"center\" hspace=\"10px\" vspace=\"0px\"></p>\n","\n","<p><img alt=\"Colaboratory logo\" height=\"250px\" src=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/assets/MLimages/Large52.jpg\" align=\"center\" hspace=\"10px\" vspace=\"0px\"></p>\n","\n","\n","Para más información pueden ver el siguiente [artículo](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e0d2/de05caacdfa8073b2b4f77c5e72cb2449b81.pdf).
